The ultraviolence in the silence
Shadows shine in the eyes of lions

We push and pull the edge of darkness
Swoon to sound of sirens

On, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
On and on I'm tired of waiting
We've got nothing here to lose

So come on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
On and on I'm tired of waiting
We've got nothing here and nothing left to choose

The ultraviolence in the silence
Shadows shine in the eyes of lions

We push and pull the edge of darkness
Swoon to sound of sirens

On, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
On and on I'm tired of waiting
We've got nothing here to lose

So come on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
On and on I'm tired of waiting
We've got nothing here and nothing left to choose

You, you know you're not the only one
Caught in the crowd and you've come undone
So bring it on
Bring it on

You're out of place but you're not alone
You've lost your way but you're wonderful
So bring it on
Bring it on

Bring it on
Bring it on
So bring it on
Bring it on
